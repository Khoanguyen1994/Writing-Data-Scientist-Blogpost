## **Project Motivation**
The Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program includes this Github repository.

I utilized Seattle Airbnb Open Data for my project. The listing activity for homestays in Seattle, Washington, is described in this dataset.

These Airbnb activities are included in this dataset:

- Listings with complete descriptions and an overall rating
- Reviews with a distinct reviewer id and thorough remarks
- Calendar with listing ID, that day's pricing, and availability

The purpose of this project is to respond to the following queries:

- What are the most frequent host confirmations in the listings?
- What characteristics of various kinds draw visitors to book a homestay?
- What factors have the biggest impact on the cost of homestays in Seattle?


## **File Descriptions**

- The seattle_airbnb_analysis.ipynb notebook provides a thorough analysis to address the queries and lucidly explains them.
- Listings.csv is the original dataset in csv format, and it can be found in the dataset/Seattle_Airbnb folder.


## **Usage**

- Use the requirements.txt file to install every package.

    `pip install -r requirements.txt` is the installation command.
    
- Create `dataset` folder

- Download the data source on Kaggle using the link provided in the `Acknowledgements` section, and then save all the CSV files to folder `dataset`.

- Run all cells in the notebook file.


## **Results**

The major conclusions are available in a blog post I wrote on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@knightsmuvnn/a-brief-overview-of-seattles-airbnb-activity-49169977fa32).
